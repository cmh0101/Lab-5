I currently spend a lot more time with code and documents in my lab work than I do in this class. Because of this, I store most of my work in a shared space within Easley (Auburn's HPC). We have specific folders and directories that all of our work is put into once it is working and in order, this way anyone in the lab or department can access it.
It is nice to have this service because it is a way for me to add being accountable and reproducable smoothly into my already existing work flow.
I think my work would stand up to a reproducibilty test. I make sure to clearly label not only the files,folders, and directories I am working within, but to also leave extensive hashed out notes within the scripts themselves.
Once I finish out my project, I will also be compiling all of my notations and alterations to the scripts and compiling them into an R Markdown document, which will also be made accessible to the rest of the lab.
In the grand scheme of things, having work that is not reproducable is only a detriment. It means work will have to be completely redone if people cannot understand what was already done or how to do it again. We had something like this happen when I joined my lab. One of the projects being done had such disordered directories and the comments on the scripts were nonexistant. This means most of this work is basically unusable.
I think both in the overarching field of bioinformatics and my own field, making your work reproducable and accessible is incredibly important and should be something stressed throughout the field.
