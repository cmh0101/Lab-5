Reflect on how you currently manage your documents and code, particularly content associated with publishable work. Would it stand up to a reproducibility test? How do you think non-reproducibile research affects computational biology and bioinformatics? What about in your specific field of study
For me, a document management simplifies its retrieval and allows me and peers/students to access what them via a simple search (better collaboration).  This is very helpful in reproducibility to be involved in code and data sharing practices. So, a well-trained biologist (trained to code and programming and to trim them beautifully so that the script can be a good resource to others) is confident to share his scripts. Now, I can manage my files to stand up to reproducibility tests.  Reproducibility is critical for many aspects of data science and helps data science teams be more productive and ensures that the results are correct. It reduces the risk of errors, thereby increasing the reliability of an experiment.
Bioinformatics tools aid in comparing, analyzing and interpreting genetic and genomic data and more generally in the understanding of evolutionary aspects of molecular biology. At a more integrative level, it helps analyze and catalogue the biological pathways and networks that are an important part of systems biology.
